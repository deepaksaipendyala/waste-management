# Waste-Management:
## WHY IS PROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT IMPORTANT?
There’s more to proper waste disposal than keeping the environment clean. Tidy surroundings reduce health risks and hazards, resulting in a healthier community. It also supports local recycling efforts and sustainability.

Take a look at the importance of proper waste disposal for the environment, health, and sustainability.

#### Maintain Environmental Cleanliness

an average person produces hundreds of kilograms of waste every year. While we’re a long way from bringing it down to zero, each person can play a part in reducing waste production. A proper waste disposal system makes people more aware of how they can limit waste production and keep their surroundings clean.

#### Improve Community Health Standards

A clean environment is a sight for sore eyes. More than looking good, however, it means better air quality and less exposure to health hazards. Tidy surroundings can also have a positive influence on an individual’s mood and behaviour. This results in better health and quality of life for people in the community.

#### Support a More Sustainable Lifestyle

A proper waste disposal management makes it easier to segregate recyclable materials and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. People can reuse some of these things or sell them to manufacturers that use recyclable materials. This limits the need to buy new products and manufacture using new materials.
